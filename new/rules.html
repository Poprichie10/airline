    <p>At Pop Richie Airline we have certain rules and regulations 
        in place to ensure a fair and secure flight booking experience

         customers and our company. Here are some key rules and regulations
          that apply to our flight website: </p>

          <p>1. Accurate Information: We strive to provide accurate and 
            up-to-date flight information on our platform. However, 
            we cannot guarantee the accuracy of all data as it is sourced 
            from various airlines and travel providers. It is the responsibility
             of users to verify the details of their flights before making a booking. 
            </p>

             <p>2. Booking Policies: Users must comply with the booking policies 
                and terms and conditions set by the airlines and travel providers. 
                This includes adhering to baggage regulations, check-in procedures, 
                and any other requirements specified by the airline.
              </p>

                <p>3. Payment and Pricing: Users are responsible for providing 
                    accurate payment information and ensuring that they have sufficient 
                    funds to complete the booking. All prices displayed on our website 
                    are subject to availability and may change without notice. Users are 
                    advised to double-check the final price, including any additional fees 
                    or charges, before finalizing their booking.  
                </p>

                  </p>

                  <p>7. Modification and Cancellation: Users should familiarize themselves with our 
                    modification and cancellation policies, as well as those of the airlines and travel
                     providers. Changes and cancellations may be subject to fees, restrictions, and availability.
